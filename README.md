Forward looking sonar for gazebo
=======================================

Sonar based on a the article **[A novel GPU-based sonar simulator for real-time applications](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849317301371)** ,and if you want a superficial overview or dont have access to science direct [Custom Shader and 3D Rendering for computationally efficient Sonar Simulation](http://sibgrapi.sid.inpe.br/col/sid.inpe.br/sibgrapi/2016/08.09.11.51/doc/sibgrapi16.pdf).

For more information, consult the [documentation](https://github.com/Brazilian-Institute-of-Robotics/forward_looking_sonar_gazebo/wiki).

But, just so you can see how it works:
